# Python-Scripting-Project

In this project, I used basic python scripting for carrying out the follwing tasks.

## Packages Used
- **os**
- **json**
- **shutil** 
(for copying and overwriting actions)
- **from subprocess import PIPE, run** (for terminal arguments so that we can compile and run go commands)
- **sys** (for accessing the command line arguments)

## Tasks Completed

- Defining the source and destinations paths.
- Seprating the whole path into base path and the directories.
- Find all the game directories from /data which is the source directory.
- Create a new /games directory i.e the target directory.
- getting full path of all the games which have the word "game "in them. 
- Copy and remove the "game" suffix of all games and move them into the /games (target) directory.
- Create a .json file which contains the metadata for the games including "Name", "No. of games".
- Compile the code of all the games.
